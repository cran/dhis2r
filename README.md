## Overview

`dhis2r` is an R client for the DHIS2 web API.

Pull data from a DHIS2 instance into R without logging into the DHIS2
user interface.

`dhis2r`, if used with Rmarkdown, quarto, Rshiny, etc., can improve
routine reporting and data requests.

### Motivation for this package

[DHIS2](https://dhis2.org/) is an open-source, web-based Health
Management Information System (HMIS), and currently being adopted in the
education sector as the Education Management Information System (EMIS)
in several countries.

More than 73 countries worldwide use DHIS2 for collecting and analyzing
health data. 2.4 billion people (30% of the world’s population) live in
countries where DHIS2 is used. (source: <https://dhis2.org/>)

With the increasing number of data managers/analysts downloading data
from DHIS2 instances to make **routine period** reports, data
visualisation and dashboards, this R package can make it much easier to
pull the required data.

There are over 2 million R users, some of whom periodically analyse data
from DHIS2; and support health programs which affect over the 2.4
billion people.

## Installation

You can install the development version of dhis2r from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("amanyiraho/dhis2r")
```

## Usage

### How to connect to a DHIS2?

Users must be authenticated to access a specific DHIS2 instance before
connecting to it.

The easiest way to connect to a DHIS2 instance using dhis2r is to use
the `username` and `password` of the DHIS2 user.

``` r
library(dhis2r)
dhis2_play_connection <- Dhis2r$new(base_url = "https://play.dhis2.org/",
                                    username = "admin",
                                    password = "district",
                                    api_version = "2.39.0.1",
                                    api_version_position = "before")
```

`Dhis2r$new()` returns a `Dhis2r` R6 class which represents a DHIS2
connection and can be used to query the DHIS2 instance

*No need to log in again when performing other querying tasks.*

### How to pull data from DHIS2

As an example, let’s pull Analytics data of
`Acute Flaccid Paralysis (Deaths < 5 yrs)`

Analytics data can include data from indicators, dataElements, program
indicators, etc.

``` r
dhis2_play_connection$get_analytics(analytic = "FTRrcoaog83", #Accute Flaccid Paralysis (Deaths < 5 yrs),
                                    org_unit = "ImspTQPwCqd", #Sierra Leone (National level)
                                    period = "LAST_12_MONTHS",
                                    output_scheme = "NAME"
                                                 )
#> # A tibble: 2 × 4
#>   analytic                                  org_unit     period        value
#>   <fct>                                     <fct>        <chr>         <dbl>
#> 1 Accute Flaccid Paralysis (Deaths < 5 yrs) Sierra Leone February 2022    34
#> 2 Accute Flaccid Paralysis (Deaths < 5 yrs) Sierra Leone January 2022     12
```

You can pull data on the following:

- Information about the account
- Access rights information about the account
- Metadata
- Organisation units
- Analytics
- All possible resources
